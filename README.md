## Project Outline
You want to model in a simplified way a management system for an airport, this will have to manage the various types of employees, the airlines present as well as the flights made by each one and the taxes they will have to pay as a transit cost.
The flights will have to be historicized, each will be made by a specific company and a defined number of pilots and flight attendants.
A table will also have to be kept for each flight which will indicate the days and times per week on which that flight will be operated. 
Within each airline will also be the employees who work there including pilots, flight attendants and salespeople.  
It is also intended to include in the design a set of employees who do not belong to any airline but are indispensable within this domain; these include air traffic controllers, mechanics, laborers, and security.
The software created will provide data entry and visualization by filtering it by specific characteristics according to the request.
For example, one could request the history of flights made by a specific pilot, the monthly amount of taxes paid by each company, or even the number of passengers who traveled with a company in a given time interval.
